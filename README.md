Mediated Mirror
===============

If a mirror is the classic interface for experiencing your own presence, what would a technologically-mediated mirror be like that doesn't let you see your own face?

This is a prototype of such a mirror. A Kinect tracks the movement of users’ heads, and a [Processing](http://www.processing.org) sketch triggers the mirror perpendicular to the user to turn via a small servo, obscuring their reflection. The prototype works with multiple users, allowing them to see other faces, but never their own.
